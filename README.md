# Gapminder-Plotly

## USE NBVIEWER

*Aim:* The aim of this project was to implement Plotly Express for rapid data visualization and analysis, Customize charts, animations, and demonstrate the various plotly.express features

## FOR MANUPULATION  
        import numpy as np
        import pandas as pd

## FOR VISUALIZATION 
        from plotly.figure_factory 
        import create_table
        import plotly.express as px
        import plotly.offline as py
        import plotly.graph_objs as go
                  
## Name of the dataset : 
        gapminder

## Type of the dataset : 
        dataframe

## Tasks:
        Loading the data
        Quick Visualization with Custom Bar charts
        Life expectency vs GDP per capita
        Plotting interactive bubble charts
        Plotting interactive animations and facet plots
        Representing geographic data as animated maps
        Plotting interactive line plots and area plots

## For Data Visualization, I used:
        bar plot
        scatter plot
        bubble charts
        facet plot
        line_geo
        choropleth
        line plot
        area plot
